 feature/implement-mongo-db
 - By default, the MongoDB container stores the databases within the /data/db directory within the container.
 - In the docker-compose file we have
 volumes:
         - /mongodb/database:/data/db # Map the containers /data/db folder to the local /mongo/db/database folder
 This is known as a bind-mount volume.
